    "## Scenario 1: Strength and elongation of a dual-phase steel\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets considder an important class of steels typicall used for automotive applications. They are typically alloyed with C, Mn + other elements to aid hardening. The name \"dual\" comes from the fact that the microstructure consists of to phases, the soft ferrite phase (F) and the hard martensite phase (M). The balance between these two are controlled first by the annealing temperature where a higher temperature promotes more austenite (A) which is the phase that martensite forms from during cooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The amount of ferrite during annealing is modelled by the function _ferrite_fraction_during_annealing()_\n",
    "\n",
    "However martensite is formed at ~400C and austenite may transform back to ferrite during cooling if the cooling rate is to low. In this little example we assume that the cooling rate is always say 100K/s, during such conditions all austenite can transform to martensite _if_ enough hardening elements are in the alloy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- How much ferrite that is transformed back to ferrite is modelled by the function _ferrite_formation_during_cooling()_\n",
    "\n",
    "At that stage we have a dual-phase microstructure at room temperature. The macroscopic properties of this steel grade is mainly governed by the fraction of the two constituents and the alloying element in each phase. The fraction of phases has a dramatic effect of the strength so the ML should ideally be able to capture that. For simplicity lets assume that the elements are evenly distributed between ferrite and martensite _except carbon_. Carbon is a small and mobile element and the solubility is much higher in austenite than in ferrite so at the annealing temperature most carbon will be there. Hence, the smaller the martensite fraction the higher its carbon content. The higher the carbon content the higher its dislocation density and hence its strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The dislocation density of the martensite is modelled by the function _dd_of_martensite_as_a_fkn_of_C()_\n",
    "- The ductility measured as the elongation is modelled by the function _longation_as_a_fkn_of_ferrite_fraction()\n",
    "\n",
    "The steel after annealing is typically referred to as \"as-quenched\", and we could calculate for example the strength using some variant of rule of mixture. After anneling it is however practise to perform \"tempering\". This is a treatment at lower tempeature, say 100-500C with the purpose of modifying microstrucure somewhat with the purpose of making the material more ductile but without too much loss in strength. Lets also include that to have more variables for the ML model to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function _dislocation_density_tempering()_ is used to model the decrease in dislocation density of martensite during tempering\n",
    "- The function _elongation_increse_by_tempering()_ is used to model the increase in ductility during tempering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The attempt was to find a small sweet-spot where the ductility can be somewhat increased without too much loss in strengh but perhaps one need to modify the parameters a bit. A good exercise is to plot all the functions!"
